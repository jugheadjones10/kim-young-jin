Some new questions I have:

Notes from videos
1. Tension is king
2. Bodybuilding technique
   - Eccentric might be more important than concentric for muscle growth
   - Controlled eccentric, explosive concentric
   - Full range of motion
   - No "cheating". Don't use momentum, maximize tension
3. Effort
   - Leave 1 rep in the tank for all sets except for the last one. For the last one, go to failure
4. Give your muscles a reason to grow
   - Progressive overload
