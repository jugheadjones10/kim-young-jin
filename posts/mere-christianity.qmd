### 1. Pride

C.S Lewis talks at length about how Pride is one of those things that is easiest to criticize in others, but hardest to find in yourself. 

It is effortless to despise the hubris of others, to whisper of their wicked arrogance behind their backs. But the great irony is that those who most despise Pride in others are in fact the most prideful of the bunch. You cannot bear to see a friend boast and receive all the attention, because you secretly wish it were you in the spotlight instead. You cannot bear to see a neighbour be successful, because you wish it were you claiming success instead.

I had a friend who always had that cocky air about him. It used to bother me a bit too much. I thought, "What good did he do, that he has the right to strut about like that?" Implicit in this statement is my belief that my friend is not as good as he makes himself out to be. It bothered me so much, because it pricked at my own outsized Pride.

A low self-esteem, and insecurity, and self-hate - it may seem paradoxical, but now I see that these, too, are manifestations of Pride. When you cannot accept who you are - when you refuse to let go of ambition - every small blemish is reason for you to bemoan your wretched self. Why am I so dumb? Why am I so slow? A great self-loathing grows from this stream of negativity.

But if you so hate these shortcomings in yourself, how much more would you despise it in others? All the people who have even less than what you have - what about them? The secretly prideful soul derives a twisted satisfaction from looking down at those beneath him. 

"At least I am better than them."

"Dull as I may be, at least I am less dull than them." 

Resentment at those above you translates into hate towards youself, and a superiority complex at those beneath you. 

Only when you embrace yourself, as you are, can you embrace others, as they are.

### 2. Morality

C.S Lewis points to the moral compass within every one of us as proof of God. As physical objects obey gravity, so do we obey the moral law. But unlike gravity, we are given a choice. Our free will means that every man, every day, makes decisions that break or keep the moral law.

I would like to believe in this. It is a compelling argument, except for that one annoying possibility that our morality comes from our Biology, not from some objective moral truth. What if evolution selected for those populations that developed emotional responses to morally "right" or "wrong" actions? Certainly we can see how it might have helped some popluations survive and not others. If that is the case, we cannot argue for an objective moral truth by only "introspecting"
on our consciences.

### 3. Free will

And that, of course, leads to the thorny issue of free will. Without free will, none of Christianity makes sense. How can we have free will? How would free will even work? In some sense, there are echoes of the "First Cause Argument" for the existence of God. It says that everything must have a cause, and so the Universe also needs to have a "first cause". Only God can be that first cause, because God is the only thing that can exist without itself having a cause (this argument is actually
flawed - the basis is that everything must have a cause, so we are contradicting ourselves by saying that God does not have a cause). 

Could we argue in a similar way about free will? That everything needs to have a cause, but free will, as something given by God, does not have a "cause" and is solely the product of our self-determining souls?

What if the day comes when we fully understand how human consciousness works, and it turns out that we actually *are* just machines running on good old cause and effect, living under the illusion of autonomy?

### 4. I hope it is all true

One part of me is sceptical, but another side of me wishes it were all true. I am starting to see the consequences that an "amoral" life and mindset is having on my psyche. It is not pretty. There is a constant feeling of emptiness, a desperate hope that there is more to life than my petty ambitions and the little games that we all play. 

One can only pray. But how can I pray, if I know no God?
