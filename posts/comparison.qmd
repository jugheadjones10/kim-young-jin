Instead of asking why someone is better than you - which forces you to look at the uncontrollable - ask *how* he might be better.
And if the answers to the how are outside of your control, accept the difference in leagues.
But it's very rare that there is nothing at all you can do to emulate a characteristic you admire.
People in general underestimate the number of things that are in their control.

The interplay of mimetic desire and social media is causing a mass convergence in the world.
Different "groups" find their respective groups online. Tech people go to tech Twitter. Fitness and beauty go to Instagram.
And so on. Everyone sees what everyone else is doing, and tries to emulate them, causing a convergence.
